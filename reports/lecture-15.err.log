**Task**  
Write Python code for Google Colab that performs multi-objective Bayesian optimization for chemists using only lists and a pandas DataFrame that the user edits by hand between runs. No widgets. No external UI. The workflow is: user defines variables and objectives, enters any existing experiments in lists, runs a function to get new suggestions, updates the lists with results after running the lab work, then calls the function again.

---

### Requirements

1) **Environment and packages**
- Use only standard Colab-friendly libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `itertools`, `scikit-learn` GaussianProcessRegressor and kernels, and `scipy` for acquisition optimization if needed.
- Random seed support for reproducibility: a single `seed` parameter.

2) **User inputs as plain Python lists**
- Independent variables: the user defines a dict named `variables` where each key is a clean name without prefix and each value is a dict with `start`, `end`, `interval`. Example:
  python
  variables = {
      "temperature": {"start": 50, "end": 100, "interval": 10},
      "time": {"start": 1, "end": 5, "interval": 1}
  }
 
- Objectives: the user defines a list `objectives` with 1 to 3 names, assumed normalized to 0..1. Example: `objectives = ["yield", "selectivity"]`.
- Objective weights: list `objective_weights`. If 1 objective, weight is [1.0]. If multiple, user provides weights that sum to 1.0. Validate the sum equals 1.0 within a small tolerance.

3) **Internal naming scheme**
- Code must convert variable names to columns with `var_` prefix and objective names to `obj_` prefix. Example: `temperature` becomes `var_temperature`, `yield` becomes `obj_yield`.
- Add a column `iteration` to track status. Use:
  - `-1` for not tried
  - `1, 2, ...` for completed iterations
  - The next suggested set gets the next integer

4) **Space construction**
- Build the full Cartesian grid from `variables` based on start, end, interval. Validate that `(end - start)` is divisible by `interval`. Raise a clear error message if not.
- Create a DataFrame `df_space` with all `var_...` columns, empty `obj_...` columns, and `iteration` initialized to `-1`.

5) **Manual data entry by the user**
- The user maintains two Python lists of equal length that describe completed experiments:
  - `run_conditions`: list of dicts for variables. Example:
    python
    run_conditions = [
        {"temperature": 70, "time": 3},
        {"temperature": 60, "time": 4},
    ]
    
  - `run_results`: list of dicts for objectives. Example:

    python
    run_results = [
        {"yield": 0.62, "selectivity": 0.80},
        {"yield": 0.55, "selectivity": 0.83},
    ]
    
- Code must validate that lengths match and all names match defined variables and objectives.

6) **Merging runs into the master DataFrame**
- A utility function updates `df_space`:
  - Finds rows that match each `run_conditions` entry on all `var_...` columns.
  - Writes the `obj_...` values.
  - Sets `iteration` to the current completed iteration number. If no prior data, set to `1`. If prior exists, set to `max(iteration) + 1` only for new rows.
- If a run condition does not appear in `df_space`, raise a helpful error that the value is out of grid.

7) **Modeling and acquisition**
- Default model is Gaussian Process with RBF kernel and WhiteKernel noise term. Use one model per objective.
- Scale inputs to 0..1 across each variable dimension before modeling. Keep a small epsilon to avoid zero length.
- Acquisition: Expected Improvement on the **weighted scalarized objective**. Steps:
  - Fit one GP per objective on completed rows.
  - Predict mean and std for each objective across all candidate points with `iteration == -1`.
  - Compute a weighted sum of predicted means to get scalar mean. For variance, combine via a simple diagonal approximation by weighting the std terms. Document that this is an approximation.
  - Compute EI vs the best observed weighted scalar value among completed rows.
- Tie-breaking for equal scores should be stable by index order.

8) **Suggestion function**
- Provide a main function:
  python
  def suggest_experiments(variables, objectives, objective_weights, run_conditions, run_results, batch_size=3, seed=123, save_csv=False, csv_path=None):
      """
      Returns:
        suggestions_df: DataFrame with the next set of suggested experiments (var_ columns only)
        df_space: Updated master DataFrame with iteration values and any new writes
      """

- Behavior:
  - Build or rebuild `df_space` from `variables`.
  - Integrate `run_conditions` and `run_results` into `df_space`.
  - If there is no completed data yet, pick `batch_size` random points from `iteration == -1` as suggestions and set their `iteration` to `1`. Return suggestions.
  - Otherwise, fit GP models as above, compute EI on all `iteration == -1` rows, pick top `batch_size` rows, set their `iteration` to `max(iteration) + 1`, and return suggestions.
  - If `save_csv` is True, write `df_space` to `csv_path` if provided, otherwise to `experiment_<timestamp>.csv`.

9) **Outputs and instructions**
- Print a short summary:
  - Number of variables and total grid size
  - Number of completed runs found
  - Batch size and iteration number suggested
- Return `suggestions_df` that shows only `var_...` columns for the user to run in the lab.
- Also return the full `df_space` so the user can save or inspect it.

10) **Round trip workflow for the user**
- First call:
  - Define `variables`, `objectives`, `objective_weights`.
  - Set `run_conditions = []` and `run_results = []` if starting fresh.
  - Call `suggest_experiments(...)` to get initial suggestions.
- After the lab:
  - Append the new completed conditions to `run_conditions` and the measured results to `run_results`.
  - Call `suggest_experiments(...)` again to receive the next suggestions.
- Provide a short example section in the notebook with a tiny space and fake results to demonstrate 2 iterations.

11) **Validation and helpful errors**
- Check weights sum to 1.0 within 1e-6.
- Check variable ranges and intervals.
- Check names match exactly.
- If no available points remain, print a clear message and return empty suggestions.

12) **No UI, no widgets, no files required**
- Everything runs in cells.
- The only persistence is optional CSV save when `save_csv=True`.
