## Using the Materials

### Run notebooks in Colab
Open any notebook and click “Open in Colab” to run directly in a browser.

### Build the Jupyter Book locally
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-book build book/
```

### Adapt for teaching
All materials are open source and can be modified freely.

📚If you would like to adapt or extend the course materials, the official Jupyter Book documentation provides clear instructions on how to build new pages, modify content, and copy existing structures for your own courses:
