## Course Description
AI4Chemistry explores how artificial intelligence can transform experimental chemistry. Topics include:
- Classification & regression
- Supervised & unsupervised learning
- Neural networks
- Generative models and transformers
- Bayesian optimization
- Computer vision for chemical analysis
- Self-driving labs and multi-agent systems  

The course emphasizes **hands-on coding** and **real applications** rather than theory alone.

## Academic Policies
- **Integrity**: Cite all sources (including AI tools). Generative AI may be used for syntax checks or brainstorming but not for submitting work.  
- **Recording**: No unauthorized recording or distribution of course materials.  
- **Accommodations**: Students needing accommodations should contact Disability Resources.  
- **Equity & Support**: University policies on harassment, reporting, and academic resources apply.
