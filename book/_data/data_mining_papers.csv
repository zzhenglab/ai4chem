10.1021/jacs.3c12086,Shaping the Water-Harvesting Behavior of Metal–Organic Frameworks Aided by Fine-Tuned GPT Models,"We construct a data set of metal–organic framework (MOF) linkers and employ a fine-tuned GPT assistant to propose MOF linker designs by mutating and modifying the existing linker structures. This strategy allows the GPT model to learn the intricate language of chemistry in molecular representations, thereby achieving an enhanced accuracy in generating linker structures compared with its base models. Aiming to highlight the significance of linker design strategies in advancing the discovery of water-harvesting MOFs, we conducted a systematic MOF variant expansion upon state-of-the-art MOF-303 utilizing a multidimensional approach that integrates linker extension with multivariate tuning strategies. We synthesized a series of isoreticular aluminum MOFs, termed Long-Arm MOFs (LAMOF-1 to LAMOF-10), featuring linkers that bear various combinations of heteroatoms in their five-membered ring moiety, replacing pyrazole with either thiophene, furan, or thiazole rings or a combination of two. Beyond their consistent and robust architecture, as demonstrated by permanent porosity and thermal stability, the LAMOF series offers a generalizable synthesis strategy. Importantly, these 10 LAMOFs establish new benchmarks for water uptake (up to 0.64 g g–1) and operational humidity ranges (between 13 and 53%), thereby expanding the diversity of water-harvesting MOFs.",https://bpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.wustl.edu/dist/0/4841/files/2025/06/shaping-the-water-harvesting-behavior.pdf
10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c01817,Hydroxamate Linkage Transformation in Porphyrin Functionalized Metal−Organic Frameworks,"This study reports the discovery of five porphyrin-based metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed from carboxylate, amide, and hydroxamate linkages. The MOFs, named the MOF-610 series (MOF-610-Co, MOF-610-Fe-1, and MOF-610-Fe-2), MOF-612, and MOF-614, were synthesized by implementing a high-throughput screening approach applying the porphyrin-based hydroxamic acid linker, 4,4′,4″,4‴-(porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzhydroxamic acid) (H6PTBHA), in combination with an array of metal ions. After their synthesis, both the MOF-610 series and MOF-612 revealed in situ transformation of the hydroxamic acid linker, resulting in carboxylate or amide coordination species, while MOF-614 was able to retain the hydroxamate moiety.",https://bpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.wustl.edu/dist/0/4841/files/2025/08/hydroxamate-linkage.pdf
10.1016/j.matt.2025.102372,Ferrous nutritional metal-organic framework as food fortificant,"Fortifying salt with both iron and iodine remains a global challenge due to their incompatibility. We report a next-generation dual-fortified salt with enhanced bioavailability, simplified processing, and improved resistance to degradation, which, using nutrient metal-organic frameworks (NuMOFs), could realize elemental iodine stabilization without converting to iodide or iodate, significantly reducing the manufacturing cost and simplifying the process.",https://bpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.wustl.edu/dist/0/4841/files/2025/08/ferrous-nutritional.pdf

10.1038/s41467-020-18427-3,Ultralight covalent organic framework/graphene aerogels with hierarchical porosity,"The fabrication of macroscopic objects from covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is challenging but of great significance to fully exploit their chemical functionality and porosity. Herein, COF/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogels synthesized by a hydrothermal approach are presented. The COFs grow in situ along the surface of the 2D graphene sheets, which are stacked in a 3D fashion, forming an ultralight aerogel with a hierarchical porous structure after freeze-drying, which can be compressed and expanded several times without breaking. The COF/rGO aerogels show excellent absorption capacity (uptake of >200 g organic solvent/g aerogel), which can be used for removal of various organic liquids from water. Moreover, as active material of supercapacitor devices, the aerogel delivers a high capacitance of 269 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and cycling stability over 5000 cycles.",https://bpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.wustl.edu/dist/0/4841/files/2025/11/s41467-020-18427-3.pdf
